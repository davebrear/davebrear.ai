*Wardrobes, storage units, and why your AI strategy shouldn't be screwed to the wall.*

I moved house last week. Anyone who's done it knows: no matter how organised you are, it's chaos.

Our old wardrobes had survived three moves. By the last house they were screwed to the wall just to stay upright. They worked, but they were creaking, and they weren't surviving a fourth trip. So we bought new ones. Same clothes, completely new storage. How many hanging rails? How many drawers? Which sections are mine, which are my wife's? Decisions we solved years ago, all reopened for a new space.

Then there's the kitchen. Same utensils, new layout. I know that I will be opening the wrong drawer for a knife for weeks to come because the muscle memory doesn't transfer.

The stuff moves easily. It's the invisible arrangement that made everything feel effortless. That's what you have to rebuild.

Somewhere in the middle of all this, surrounded by boxes, I realised I'd already solved this problem at work.

I run AI agents daily. Every few weeks a new model drops that's better at something I care about. Months ago I built a local context layer that decouples my knowledge from any single model. Switching is painless. The house move reminded me how much harder it is when you haven't done that decoupling.

The house is swappable. The people and possessions persist.
The model is swappable. Your judgement and context persist.

What made my house move survivable? A storage unit. An escrow for our possessions, independent of either house. Decouple the stuff from the structure and moving becomes a logistics problem, not an existential one.

That storage unit is the context layer. Independent of any model, in your control, ready to plug in wherever you go next.

## You're going to move. A lot.

The pace of model development is relentless. The best option for a given use case changes constantly, and no single model wins everywhere. One model excels at structured analysis. Another at creative synthesis. Another at code generation. There's a best model for each job, and that answer shifts every few weeks.

It's not just about switching vendors either. This same week I spent 48 hours of missed connections travelling to the States. No reliable internet for long stretches. I plugged my context vault into a local LLM running on my MacBook and kept working. The same [workflow I've written about before](/posts/brainstorming-workflow/), running on a completely different model, offline, at 35,000 feet. Frontier model, local model, offline model: the context doesn't care where it runs.

Let me tell you something that would have sounded absurd to me a year ago: in 2026, the right context paired with a local model on modest hardware can actually beat a frontier model with incomplete context. Intelligence has scaled dramatically. Memory hasn't. Every new chat window is amnesia. The most capable model in the world starts every conversation knowing nothing about you. Context is the differentiator, not the model.

And these local models aren't toys anymore. Even a small LLM capable of running on a laptop carries distilled human reasoning in a portable file. Pair that with your own rich context and you have something genuinely powerful: offline, private, and entirely in your control. The quality gap between local and frontier is narrowing fast. That's a topic for another post, but the implication for this one is clear: your context layer is the multiplier, regardless of where the model runs.

You will switch models this year, probably more than once, to capitalize on the latest capabilities.

## The vendor memory trap

Most LLM platforms now offer "memory" features. Convenient. But it's their storage, not yours.

At best, you're reliant on their good grace to offer an export. On their timeline, in their format. At worst, it's locked context. You switch provider, you start from zero. All that accumulated knowledge, gone.

Then there's security. Your organisational context: client names, strategic thinking, decision patterns. Sitting on someone else's infrastructure. Shouldn't that data remain in your control?

Vendor memory is renting furnished. Feels easy until you try to leave.

## Build the storage unit

Here's my prescription.

Separate your organisational knowledge from the model layer. Store context in formats you control: plain text, structured metadata in open formats without proprietary lock-in. Treat prompts and workflows as assets, not throwaway chat messages. When you switch models, nothing is lost.

But storing context isn't enough. It needs to be intelligently referenceable. I've [written before](/posts/the-fourth-search/) about the four modalities of knowledge retrieval: keyword search finds what you said, metadata finds what you filed, graph traversal finds what you connected, and semantic search finds what you meant.

The new model walks in and finds everything where it should be, without rummaging in the cutlery drawer to find that knife.

Owning the context layer means you control how it's retrieved: keyword, metadata, graph, semantic, chained however your use case demands. Vendor memory gives you one black-box retrieval method. You get zero say in how your context is surfaced.

## What this unlocks for the enterprise

Once you own the context layer, new capabilities open up.

- **Context-aware routing.** Different tasks can be routed to different models based on sensitivity, cost, and complexity. Not one model for everything. The right model for each job.
- **Governance.** Enterprise context needs classification, audit trails, and retention policies. Self hosting gives you granular control. Vendor memory offers none of it.
- **Compounding value.** A well-maintained context layer gets more valuable over time. Every interaction, every meeting, every decision enriches it. Vendor memory resets when you move. Your context layer compounds.
- **The widening gap.** The longer you invest in a portable, governed context layer, the wider the gap between your AI capability and someone starting from scratch with a new model's blank memory.

Own the context layer and every model switch becomes an upgrade, not a restart.

## Where to start

**Audit your context dependency.** Where does your team's accumulated AI knowledge actually live right now? If the answer is inside a vendor's conversation history, you have a portability problem you haven't priced in yet.

**Separate context from model.** Start storing prompts, workflows, and institutional knowledge in formats you control. Plain text. Structured metadata. Version controlled. Not inside a vendor's memory feature.

**Stop evaluating models in isolation.** Build what I call a workflow package: skill + prompt + context. The skill defines what to do. The prompt defines how to instruct. The context defines what to know. Run the same workflow package against each new model as it drops. Benchmark model + workflow together, not model alone. When you own the workflow package, every new model release becomes a simple swap-and-compare. That's only possible if the components are yours.

## Still unpacking

I'll be honest: the boxes are not all unpacked. I left for a conference 3,000 miles away 24 hours after moving day, leaving my wife with the aftermath. The wardrobes haven't even been delivered yet, so we're living out of clothes bags. We're finding things we forgot we owned and wondering where others have gone.

But there's light at the end of the tunnel, and it's because of the preparation. The storage unit. The planning. The decoupling. The chaos is temporary because the foundations were laid well ahead of the move (full credit to my brilliant wife, who masterminded everything).

Same energy for the context layer. The tooling is maturing. The formats are open. The patterns are proven. We're early, but the path is clear.

Moving house is hard. I'm living proof. But owning the preparation is what turns chaos into progress. Moving models doesn't have to be hard at all. And once you own the context, every move is an upgrade.
